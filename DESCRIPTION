Description: Assigns standardized diagnoses using the Banff Classification
    (Category 1 to 6 diagnoses, including Acute and Chronic active T-cell
    mediated rejection as well as Active, Chronic active, and Chronic antibody
    mediated rejection). The main function considers a minimal dataset
    containing biopsies information in a specific format (described by a data
    dictionary), verifies its content and format (based on the data dictionary),
    assigns diagnoses, and creates a summary report. The package is developed on
    the reference guide to the Banff classification of renal allograft pathology
    Roufosse C, Simmonds N, Clahsen-van Groningen M, et al. A (2018) <doi:10.1097/TP.0000000000002366>.
    The full description of the Banff classification is available at <https://banfffoundation.org/>.
